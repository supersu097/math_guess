# Background
I discover  ied this math law since i was in primary school, as for which grade i remembered it was around second or third.  
But at that moment, i just manully calculate this within the number of 20. Then when i was in senir high school, i remembered it was manully calculated to the number 1000 or so. Now i use the computer program to help me automatically compute this math guess. also i found whatever how much huge the integer i specify as the initial computing number, such math law can still apply on that number.

# Description

At first, i show u two screenshots as below.
